Main criteria of a mycelium web server:
1.	Federated learning: Trains AI model based on decentralized, federated learning (volunteer-based computing)
2.	Mycelial-Net protocol: Nodes can change learning groups based on evolutionary, Peer-to-peer-based protocol on top of decentralized, federated learning
3.	Social Web-Integration: Integrated in ActivityPub (for feedback; users can also contribute knowledge and make requests)
4.	Semantic Web-Integration: AI has access to knowledge graph (both for data retrieval, model saving and collaboration for protocol, e.g. sharing of information.
5.	User-Fungus-Symbiosis-Policy: There is a policy in place that ensures a symbiosis between humans and fungi, which ensures the growth of both living forms and ensures the overall well being of both the web and humanity as a whole (with the latter prioritized of course). This can be ensured for example by prompting users to contribute knowledge if there are stubs in the knowledge base.
