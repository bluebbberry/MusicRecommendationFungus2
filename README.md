# MyceliumWeb Server 2

## Main criteria of a mycelium web server:

1.	Federated learning: Trains AI model based on decentralized, federated learning (volunteer-based computing)
2.	Mycelial-Net protocol: Nodes can change learning groups based on evolutionary, Peer-to-peer-based protocol on top of decentralized, federated learning
3.	Social Web-Integration: Integrated in ActivityPub (for feedback; users can also contribute knowledge and make requests)
4.	Semantic Web-Integration: AI has access to knowledge graph (both for data retrieval, model saving and collaboration for protocol, e.g. sharing of information.
5.	User-Fungus-Symbiosis-Policy: There is a policy in place that ensures a symbiosis between humans and fungi, which ensures the growth of both living forms and ensures the overall well being of both the web and humanity as a whole (with the latter prioritized of course). This can be ensured for example by prompting users to contribute knowledge if there are stubs in the knowledge base.

## Implemented in MyceliumWebServer1

1. Federated learning: train rudimentary neural net that can recommend songs. The nodes write in shared knowledge base. Link to knowledge graph is shared over Fediverse hashtags.
2. Mycelium-Net protocol: calculate fitness based on user feedback from Fediverse; based on this change learning group and randomly mutate behaviour.
3. Social Web-Integration: using .env-file, the server can communicate over a Mastodon account.
4. Semantic Web-Integration: use shared Apache Jena Fuseki server
5. User-Fungus-Symbioses-Policy: users can insert knowledge on a voluntary basis. It is planned that users can enter a researcher-mode, in which the fungus give users research tasks based on their selected research topics, for knowledge, which currently does not exist in the knowledge base

## Improvements over Mycelium Web Server 1

- now integrated in ActivityPods (planned)
- trains general language model (planned)
- gives users tasks for research knowledge (planned)
- implements decentralized federated learning based on ActivityPub protocol (planned)
- using the UI, users can browse all AI models connected over the mycelial protocol (planned)
- actually implement mycelial "SPORE" protocol based on evoluationary algorithms (planned)
